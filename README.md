# search_or_sort
Contains program that shows efficiency of different sorting and searching algorithms by using a large input and printing elapsed time of each function.

Computers make computations so fast that we it is easy to overlook the efficiency of an algorithm. This program uses an input of 50,000 to help better understand the difference in time one sorting/searching algorithm can have over another. With this large input, the selection sort and insertion sort can take over a minute, while mergesort and quicksort take less than a second. 

Sorting algorithms used:
- selection sort
- insertion sort
- mergesort
- quicksort

Searching algorithms used:
- sequential search
- binary search
